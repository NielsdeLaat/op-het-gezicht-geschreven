# Op het gezicht geschreven?

A poetic, interactive installation for the Holobox, designed to make the invisible inner world of people visible. Visitors see a stream of holographic figures passing by. By tapping on a figure, the stream stops and fragments of that person’s inner world are revealed through text, sound, and visuals. The goal is to invite visitors to pause, empathize, and reflect on what remains hidden in everyday life.
